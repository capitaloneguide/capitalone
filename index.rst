Before You Start
----------------

- Your new card (card number, expiration date, and security code)
- Primary cardholder info for verification (e.g., last 4 of SSN/ITIN for U.S. accounts)
- Your Capital One login or access to your email/phone for verification codes

#. Visit `capitalone.com/activate <https://www.capitalone.com/activate/>`_.
#. Sign in (or enroll if you’re new).
#. Select the card to activate and follow the prompts (security code, identity check).
#. Wait for the confirmation that your card is active.

Option 2: Activate in the Capital One Mobile App
------------------------------------------------

#. Open the app and sign in.
#. Tap the card that needs activation.
#. Choose **Activate** (or **Finish Setup**) and follow the steps.

---------------------------

- Call the activation number shown on the sticker on your new card.
- Follow the automated prompts to verify your identity and activate.
- Ask for a representative if you prefer live assistance.

.. tip::
   After activation, remove the sticker so it doesn’t cover card details later.

Troubleshooting
---------------
